# Step 9: Main Screen - Current Task Display - Completion Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the core task execution interface for the Routine Timer app with all required features.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Main Routine Screen UI ✅
- **Dynamic background color**: Green by default, changes to red when timer goes negative
- **Large task name display**: Positioned at top center with large, bold text (48px)
- **Massive countdown timer**: Displays time in MM:SS format (120px font size)
- **Slim progress bar**: Shows task completion percentage in real-time
- **Previous and Done buttons**: Positioned below the progress bar with proper styling

### 2. Timer Logic ✅
- **Task loading**: Loads first task from BLoC state on screen initialization
- **Countdown from estimated duration**: Timer starts at task's estimated duration
- **Updates every second**: Timer decrements every second automatically
- **Negative timer support**: Timer continues into negative values (displayed as -MM:SS)
- **Background color change**: Automatically changes from green to red when timer goes negative
- **Proper initialization**: Uses post-frame callback to avoid setState during build

### 3. Progress Bar ✅
- **Percentage calculation**: Shows elapsed time as percentage of estimated duration
- **Real-time updates**: Updates smoothly with timer countdown
- **Visual feedback**: White bar on semi-transparent background

### 4. Done Button ✅
- **Mark task complete**: Records actual time taken for the task
- **Advance to next task**: Automatically moves to next task in sequence
- **Timer reset**: Resets timer to next task's estimated duration
- **BLoC integration**: Dispatches `MarkTaskDone` event with actual duration

### 5. Previous Button ✅
- **Navigate back**: Returns to previous task
- **Timer restoration**: Resets timer to previous task's estimated duration
- **Disabled state**: Properly disabled when on first task
- **BLoC integration**: Dispatches `GoToPreviousTask` event

## Technical Implementation

### Key Files Modified
1. `/workspace/lib/src/screens/main_routine_screen.dart` - Main implementation
2. `/workspace/test/src/screens/main_routine_screen_test.dart` - Comprehensive tests
3. `/workspace/test/main_test.dart` - Updated integration tests

### Code Quality
- ✅ All tests passing (126 tests)
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ No deprecation warnings
- ✅ Follows Flutter best practices
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Clean state management

### Test Coverage
The implementation includes comprehensive tests covering:
- Display of current task and timer
- Done button advancing to next task
- Previous button returning to previous task
- Previous button disabled on first task
- Timer countdown functionality
- Empty tasks list handling
- Initial green background
- Progress bar updates

## Verification Steps Completed
1. ✅ App runs without errors
2. ✅ Timer counts down correctly every second
3. ✅ Timer format handles negative values (-MM:SS)
4. ✅ Background changes to red when timer goes negative
5. ✅ Done button advances to next task with timer reset
6. ✅ Previous button returns to previous task with timer reset
7. ✅ Progress bar updates smoothly in real-time
8. ✅ All automated tests pass

## Architecture Highlights
- **StatefulWidget**: Used for managing timer state
- **BLoC pattern**: Integration with existing `RoutineBloc` for task management
- **Timer management**: Proper disposal of timers to prevent memory leaks
- **Post-frame callbacks**: Used to avoid setState during build phase
- **Responsive design**: Uses `Spacer` and flexible layouts for various screen sizes

## Next Steps
The Main Routine Screen is now fully functional and ready for the next development phase. Suggested improvements could include:
- Pause/resume timer functionality
- Sound notifications when timer reaches zero
- Haptic feedback on button presses
- Task completion animations
- Persistence of timer state across app restarts
